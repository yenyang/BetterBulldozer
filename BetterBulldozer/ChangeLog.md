# Update V1.3.0
* Overhauled "Remove Moving Objects and Cims" tool mode. Now has two selection modes: Single and Radius. 
	* Single exclusively targets moving objects. 
	* Radius removes ALL vehicles, cims, and animals in the radius and vertically above or below including broken, stuck, vehicles placed by player, and animals spawned by player placed spawners.
* Filters for vanilla bulldoze tool with no tool modes selected including: Networks, Buildings, Trees, Plants, Decals, and Props. Toggling these filters off makes it so the bulldoze tool cannot remove those items.
	This helps deal with overlapping items from Anarchy but doesn't fix all issues related to that.
* Optimized multiple systems
* Compatible with V1.1.5 of the base game.
