Easily delete things that you otherwise could not delete or easily delete.

Sully made a Youtube video about custom car parks (aka Parking Lots) and this functionality helped make that safe.

# Detailed Descrption
* Icon for game manipulation that allows you to use the bulldozer on moving objects such as vehicles or cims.
* Icon for bypass confirmation that disables the prompt for whether you are sure you want to demolish a building.
* Icon and filters to show and EXCLUSIVELY target invisible paths, roads, etc or static object markers with the bulldozer and remove paths, roads, etc or static object markers. See below.
* Icon and filters to EXCLUSIVELY target surfaces or spaces with the bulldozer and remove with one click. Works both inside and outside of assets.
* Icon to EXCLUSIVELY target standalone lanes with the bulldozer such as interconnected fences, interconnected hedges, linear street markings, vehicle and pedestrian lanes. You cannot create these in-game without a mod for it.
* Automatically manages the "Show Markers" DevUI option while plopping, drawing, and bulldozing applicable objects and networks. 

## Invisible Paths and Markers
Drawing invisible paths and markers is an unsupported feature of the game. You need DevUI to access the 'Add Object' menu via the home button to draw invisible paths and markers, unless another mod makes this more convenient.

With the Bulldoze tool you can select an icon and filters to show and EXCLUSIVELY demolish invisible networks or invisible parking decals, various spots, points, and spawners, BUT SAVE BEFORE HAND!

One configuration I built/demolished resulted in a crash to desktop because I left a segment that was too short. Deleting them in a different order worked.

You cannot demolish invisible paths and markers within buildings.

## Planned Work-In-Progress Features
* Removing subelements of assets.
* Automatic removal of grass surfaces.
* Automatic removal of fences and hedges.
